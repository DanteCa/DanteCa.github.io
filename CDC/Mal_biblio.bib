    abstract = { A Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) has been developed. Its purpose is to ingest satellite- and ground-based observational data products, using advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques, in order to generate optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes. GLDAS is unique in that it is an uncoupled land surface modeling system that drives multiple models, integrates a huge quantity of observation-based data, runs globally at high resolution (0.25°), and produces results in near–real time (typically within 48 h of the present). GLDAS is also a test bed for innovative modeling and assimilation capabilities. A vegetation-based “tiling” approach is used to simulate subgrid-scale variability, with a 1-km global vegetation dataset as its basis. Soil and elevation parameters are based on high-resolution global datasets. Observation-based precipitation and downward radiation and output fields from the best available global coupled atmospheric data assimilation systems are employed as forcing data. The high-quality, global land surface fields provided by GLDAS will be used to initialize weather and climate prediction models and will promote various hydrometeorological studies and applications. The ongoing GLDAS archive (started in 2001) of modeled and observed, global, surface meteorological data, parameter maps, and output is publicly available. }

abstract = {Abstract The Amazon has a well-defined wet austral summer monsoon and dry winter monsoon precipitation regime and experienced a sequence of drought events in the last 13 years. This study performs a comparative assessment of observed and predicted climate conditions during the three most recent drought events in the Amazon, in 1997–1998, 2004–2005 and 2009–2010, with emphasis on how these events affected the regional monsoon-like precipitation regime. A century long Negro River level time series at Manaus is investigated, applying extreme values theory for estimating return periods of these major drought events. Possible teleconnections of river levels at Manaus and sea surface temperature at remote regions are explored. Large scale oceanic and atmospheric conditions are investigated to highlight the mechanisms associated with the observed drought conditions, particularly during the dry monsoon season. Satellite estimates are used for diagnosing biomass burning aerosol and discuss possible contributions to the observed precipitation deficits in the 2005 and 2010 drought events during the dry monsoon season. The study is concluded with an analysis of the performance of seasonal precipitation predictions for the dry monsoon seasons of July to September 1998, 2005 and 2010 produced with the operational seasonal prediction system used at the Center for Weather Forecasts and Climate Studies (CPTEC) of the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE). This system was capable of producing 1 month in advance drought warning for the three investigated events, relevant for helping the government and local population make decisions for reducing drought impacts in the Amazon region.

    abstract = { A practical step-by-step guide to wavelet analysis is given, with examples taken from time series of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The guide includes a comparison to the windowed Fourier transform, the choice of an appropriate wavelet basis function, edge effects due to finite-length time series, and the relationship between wavelet scale and Fourier frequency. New statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals. It is shown that smoothing in time or scale can be used to increase the confidence of the wavelet spectrum. Empirical formulas are given for the effect of smoothing on significance levels and confidence intervals. Extensions to wavelet analysis such as filtering, the power Hovmöller, cross-wavelet spectra, and coherence are described. The statistical significance tests are used to give a quantitative measure of changes in ENSO variance on interdecadal timescales. Using new datasets that extend back to 1871, the Niño3 sea surface temperature and the Southern Oscillation index show significantly higher power during 1880–1920 and 1960–90, and lower power during 1920–60, as well as a possible 15-yr modulation of variance. The power Hovmöller of sea level pressure shows significant variations in 2–8-yr wavelet power in both longitude and time. }
